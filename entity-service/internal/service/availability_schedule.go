// *** THIS IS DELIBERATELY NOT A GLIDESCHEDULE PORT. ***
// GlideSchedule supports excluded spans, child schedules, span-level
// timezones and several recurrence vocabularies. Reimplementing all of that
// from the outside, with no instance to check against, would produce
// something that looks right and is wrong in cases nobody enumerated — and
// the output is a percentage on a customer-facing status page, where "wrong
// but plausible" is the worst possible failure.
//
// So this supports exactly the shapes the live data actually uses, and
// REFUSES anything else. A subject whose schedule it cannot model fails,
// gets logged, and keeps its previous row — which is visibly stale rather
// than quietly incorrect.
//
// What the live data is: all seven commitments on the instance reference one
// schedule, the stock "24 x 7". That degenerates to AlwaysOn, and is
// recognised as such below rather than being evaluated span by span.

// SpanSchedule covers the intervals its spans describe.
